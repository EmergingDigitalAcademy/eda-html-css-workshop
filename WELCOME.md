Welcome to EDAs Intro to HTML/CSS Workshop!

Please make sure that you have installed the Atom text editor (http://atom.io).
Once installed, create a new folder and open Atom so that it looks like this!

  - Create a new folder on your desktop called 'html_workshop'
  - File -> Open and select the folder (you will see it on the left in Atom)
  - (Optional) create an empty index.html. We'll create the rest together.
